# ADR-0002 — Governance of Permissioned Technical Capabilities (Public)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Visibility:** Public Transparency Edition  
**Framework:** BuzzFlow CE2E  
**Legal Layer:** BuzzLaw  

---

## Context

Modern platforms expose technical capabilities that may affect privacy, safety, security, or regulatory posture if misused, misunderstood, or deployed without constraint.

Examples include (but are not limited to):

- Elevated system permissions  
- Latent technical controls  
- Background processing or monitoring capabilities  
- Cross-boundary data access  

ADR-0002 documents **why** such capabilities require governance, **how** risk is framed at a policy level, and **what assurances are provided to users and reviewers**, without exposing enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Decision

The system SHALL govern permissioned technical capabilities under a **policy-first governance model** with the following principles:

1. **Purpose Limitation**  
   Capabilities are enabled only for explicit, documented purposes.

2. **Scope Control**  
   Access is bounded by technical, legal, and contextual constraints.

3. **User Transparency**  
   Users receive clear disclosure of capability intent and impact.

4. **Separation of Policy and Enforcement**  
   Public governance artifacts describe intent and safeguards, while enforcement logic remains internal.

5. **Auditability Without Exposure**  
   Governance decisions are reviewable without revealing sensitive implementation details.

---

## Risk Framing

This ADR addresses risks including:

- Capability overreach or misuse  
- Ambiguous user consent  
- Unintended secondary use  
- Regulatory or contractual misalignment  

Risk is mitigated through governance design rather than reactive controls alone.

---

## Public Safeguards

This ADR guarantees that:

- Capabilities are not activated without a documented policy basis  
- Disclosures are accurate and non-misleading  
- User-impacting functionality is governed before deployment  

---

## Out of Scope (Public)

This document does **not** include:

- Enforcement algorithms or thresholds  
- Internal monitoring or telemetry  
- Platform-specific implementations  
- Incident response procedures  

These elements are governed separately under controlled access.

---

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Clear governance signal to users and reviewers  
- Reduced ambiguity around sensitive capabilities  
- Strong separation of transparency and security  

**Trade-offs**
- Enforcement details are not publicly inspectable  
- Trust is placed in governance rather than code disclosure

## Notes

This document represents the **authoritative public statement** of intent for ADR
