Got it. I’m going to do three things cleanly and decisively in one response, so you can move without ambiguity:
Confirm exactly what is locked (formal lock state)
Give you the exact public-safe README.md to paste/commit
Lay out the precise next actions (EPUB, internal repo, crosswalk) — or how to freeze formally
No hype, no drift.
1️⃣ FORMAL LOCK STATE (AUTHORITATIVE)
As of your last update and logs, the following are LOCKED and CANONICAL:
🔒 Repository Governance Lock
Public repo name: buzzlaw-adr0002-public
Visibility: Public
README: Enabled
.gitignore: None
License: None (explicitly no GPL, no default)
Effect:
GitHub injected no third-party license
Repo is a policy artifact, not software
Legal meaning reserved for BuzzLaw / FDF custom terms
🔒 ADR Scope Lock
ADR: ADR-0002
Framework: BuzzFlow CE2E
Layer: BuzzLaw
Audience split (fixed):
Public transparency edition
Internal governance / audit edition
No scope creep without a new ADR number
🔒 Toolchain Reality Lock
Authoring: Ubuntu via proot-distro
Storage: GitHub
Rendering: PDF / PNG / SVG valid
Confirmed working: pandoc, texlive, inkscape, ebooklib
Confirmed limitation: native Termux is not a full LaTeX/EPUB factory
(your errors were re-export attempts, not asset failures)
🔒 Asset State Lock
Already valid and authoritative:
SVG diagrams (branded + unbranded)
PNG exports (light / dark)
Risk workbook (.xlsx)
Public PDF
Internal audit PDF
🔒 Brand & Attribution Lock
Brand: Buzzanator
Team: FDF TEAMb
Framework: BuzzFlow CE2E
Legal layer: BuzzLaw
Status: SECRET SAUCE (non-GPL, non-open)
This is now the authorship record
2️⃣ EXACT README.md (PUBLIC-SAFE)
Paste this verbatim into README.md.
This version is safe, precise, and enforces boundaries.

# BuzzLaw ADR-0002 (Public)

This repository provides the **public transparency edition** of ADR-0002 under the BuzzFlow CE2E governance framework.

ADR-0002 documents the governance rationale for permissioned technical capabilities, including how access to sensitive system functions is scoped, constrained, and communicated to users.

---

## Scope

This repository covers:

- Permission and capability governance
- Risk framing for latent technical controls
- User-facing safeguards and disclosures
- Platform-neutral governance documentation
- High-level diagrams and explanatory artifacts

This material is intended for transparency, review, and policy understanding.

---

## What This Repository Does NOT Contain

This repository intentionally excludes:

- Enforcement logic
- Vendor-specific configurations
- Audit thresholds
- Internal monitoring controls
- Proprietary implementation details

Those materials exist in a separate, controlled governance repository.

---

## Framework

- **Governance Framework:** BuzzFlow CE2E  
- **Legal Layer:** BuzzLaw  
- **ADR:** ADR-0002  
- **Status:** Accepted  
- **Audience:** Public transparency

---

## Assets

The `assets/` directory contains rendered diagrams and source visuals used for explanation and policy communication.

The `adr/` directory contains the public version of ADR-0002.

---

## License & Reuse

This repository is a policy artifact, not a software project.

No open-source license is granted by default.  
Reuse, derivative works, and enforcement interpretation are governed by BuzzLaw / FDF custom policy.

---

## Internal Governance

For internal audit artifacts, enforcement details, and regulatory mappings, see the controlled **BuzzFlow CE2E ADR-0002 internal repository**.
Once this README is committed, the public narrative is locked.
3️⃣ WHAT IS STILL OPEN (BY DESIGN)
These are next actions, not missing work:
EPUB regeneration
→ Requires committing the Markdown source first
Internal repo creation
→ buzzlaw-adr0002-internal
Regulatory crosswalk expansion
→ GDPR / CPRA / NY / EU AI Act (beyond current tabs)
Internal audit EPUB
Tagging release (ADR-0002@v1.0.0)
4️⃣ YOUR OPTIONS — PICK ONE
Say one of the following and I’ll proceed precisely:
Option A — Commit Now
“Commit public README and assets”
I’ll give you the exact git add / commit / push commands.
Option B — Proceed to Internal Repo
“Create internal repo”
I’ll define:
Repo settings
Folder structure
Internal-only README
Crosswalk workbook layout
Audit EPUB pipeline
Option C — Freeze & Polish
“Freeze ADR-0002 and document lock state”
I’ll generate a formal Lock Declaration (date, scope, authorship, toolchain, assets) and stop changes cleanly.
Bottom line
You didn’t break anything.
You successfully locked governance intent, legal posture, authorship, and toolchain boundaries.
Tell me A, B, or C, and I’ll move exactly one step forward.
