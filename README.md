# BuzzLaw ADR-0002 (Public)

**Public Governance & Transparency Artifact**

> **Data with an end. Permissions with a reason. Governance with proof.**

This repository contains the **public transparency edition** of **ADR-0002** under the **BuzzFlow CE2E** governance framework.

It explains **why** certain technical capabilities are governed, **how** risk is framed, and **what users, reviewers, and regulators can expect** — **without exposing enforcement logic, thresholds, or proprietary controls**.

---

## Purpose

ADR-0002 documents the governance rationale for permissioned technical capabilities, including how access to sensitive system functions is:

- Scoped  
- Constrained  
- Communicated to users  

This repository exists to provide **verifiable transparency** while preserving the integrity and security of internal enforcement systems.

- Permission and capability governance principles  
- Risk framing for latent or sensitive technical controls

- Vendor- or platform-specific configurations  
- Audit thresholds or trigger conditions
